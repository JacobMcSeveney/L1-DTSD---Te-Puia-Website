            <h2>National Weaving School (Te Rito)</h2>
            <p>At the National Weaving school, students are 
               taught the skills and traditions of a craft 
               hundreds of years old. “I believe weaving can 
               only be learnt the old way - by sitting, by 
               listening, by touching and by doing,” says 
               head of the weaving school, Edna Pahewa.
               As well as learning how to weave harakeke 
               (flax) and other materials, students learn 
               the stories and designs unique to each iwi 
               (tribe), as well as the Māori protocols 
               associated with weaving. These include planting 
               according to the phases of the moon and reciting 
               prayers of thanks for flax and trees used.
               Te Rito is named after the baby shoot that sits 
               deep at the heart of the flax. That baby is protected
               by two outside shoots, the mother and father. 
               Students learn never to touch the inner three 
               shoots when cutting the flax as they are the 
               nucleus - the family unit too precious to be 
               broken. Without these shoots, the flax will 
               lose its identity.
               Māori used various art forms to record their 
               histories and stories, preserving them for 
               future generations. Weaving patterns and 
               styles were designed to symbolise particular 
               stories and these were handed down within a family or tribe.

            <h2>National Carving School - Te Wānanga Whakairo</h2>
            <p>
               Before Europeans and European weapons arrived in Aotearoa, 
               Māori warfare mainly involved hand-to-hand combat. Warriors 
               used many different hand weapons, including taiaha (fighting
               staffs), pouwhenua (pointed staffs), tewhatewha (axe-like 
               staffs), tao (short spears), huata (long spears) and patu 
               (clubs). The long weapons were carried, and the small clubs
               were often tucked into a belt. Special weapons were sometimes
               given names and passed down through generations.Wars could be
               fought over land and resources, but also as utu (revenge) or 
               to increase mana (prestige). There were many traditions
               and rules to be followed during battles in earlier times. War 
               parties (taua) could range in size from a small group to a few 
               hundred people. Most battles took place in the summer months
               after the harvesting of crops was completed. The element of 
               surprise was important, so raids often happened at dawn.
               Though there were deaths and injuries as a result of skirmishes
               in pre-European times, the numbers were very small in comparison
               to the slaughter that occurred when muskets became available.
