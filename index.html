                <h1>National Weaving School (Te Rito)</h1>
                <p>When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly 
                    discovered that flax could be woven to make 
                    clothing, housing materials and decorative tūrapa (panels) 
                    for their houses.
                    Two native species of flax both come from the lily family. 
                    Harakeke (common flax) grows up to three meters high and 
                    has firm, long leaves with a fine muka fibre, ideal for 
                    all types of weaving. Wharariki (mountain flax) is found 
                    along coast lines, growing up to 1.6 meters with softer 
                    leaves and less fibre than harakeke.</p>

                <h1>National Carving School - Te Wānanga Whakairo</h1>
                <p>
                    In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School 
                    began the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori 
                    ancestors. Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man 
                    who would become master carver of the institute today.
                    Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away 
                    traditional Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted 
                    pieces made at our National Carving School. Look for 
                    the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity. We also accept 
                    carving commissions.
