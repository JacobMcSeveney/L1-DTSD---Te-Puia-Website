            <h3>National Weaving School (Te Rito)</h3>
            <p>When our ancestors arrived to New Zealand they quickly 
               discovered that flax could be woven to make 
               clothing, housing materials and decorative tūrapa (panels) 
               for their houses.
               Two native species of flax both come from the lily family. 
               Harakeke (common flax) grows up to three meters high and 
               has firm, long leaves with a fine muka fibre, ideal for 
               all types of weaving. Wharariki (mountain flax) is found 
               along coast lines, growing up to 1.6 meters with softer 
               leaves and less fibre than harakeke.

            <h3>National Carving School - Te Wānanga Whakairo</h3>
            <p>
               In 1967, the first intake to the National Carving School 
               began the task of learning the disciplines of their Māori 
               ancestors. Among those students was Clive Fugill, the man 
               who would become master carver of the institute today.
               Here at Te Puia we offer you the chance to take away 
               traditional Māori carvings; beautiful handcrafted 
               pieces made at our National Carving School. Look for 
               the Te Puia Official Mark of Authenticity. We also accept 
               carving commissions.
