            story in Rotorua's geothermal wonderland awakens, and you're invited
             to be part 
            of it. Geyser By Night is a magical journey that until now, was a

            guarded secret. Te Whakarewarewa geothermal valley reveals its 
            secrets under 
            the velvet embrace of night, promising a sensory spectacle that 
            exists nowhere 
            else on Earth. This evening walking tour explores parts of the 
            geothermal valley
            that are not seen during the day.
