               Watch skilled carvers and weavers demonstrate their expertise at
               the New Zealand Māori 
               Arts and Crafts Institute, where indigenous 
               material culture is on display through the lens 
               of internationally recognized artists.
               During the day, embark on the Te Rā Guided Experience, led by 
               passionate guides

               Explore a 
               Jurassic-like landscape featuring native bush, geysers, and mud 
               pools.
               Add a spine-tingling cultural performance to your tour for 
               the Te Rā + Haka combo. This includes the 
               traditional welcome ceremony, songs, chants, poi, and 
               haka within the impressive traditionally 
               carved wharenui or meeting house.
               When the sun goes down, Te Puia takes on a 
               whole new life and feel. Enjoy a Hāngī Buffet Dinner + 
               Haka with our evening Te Pō from 5:30pm or upgrade to our

               beneath the 
               stars, surrounded by geothermal steam and sound.
               As the sun sets and the world hushes into darkness, the most 
               captivating love story in Rotorua's geothermal 
               wonderland awakens, and you're invited to be part of it. 
               Geyser By Night is a magical journey that until now, was a 
               closely 
               guarded secret. Te Whakarewarewa geothermal valley reveals its 
               secrets under 
               the velvet embrace of night, promising a sensory spectacle that 
               exists nowhere 
               else on Earth. This evening walking tour explores parts of the 
               geothermal valley
               that are not seen during the day.

            <h2 class="card-text">Mud Pools</h2>
            <p>
               The mud pool is the result of acid gases and steam that cause 
               the decomposition of minerals (feldspars) to form a clay called
               kaolin. Kaolin is white when pure, but finely 
               divided black sulphur turns it to grey.
               The activity varies with the amount of rainfall, but the 
               temperature of the steaming bursts of mud is approximately 
               90-95 degrees Celsius (194-203 degrees Fahrenheit).
               This mud pool is also known as the “Frog Pool” because of the 
               similarity between the plopping mud and leaping frogs.
               Some pools contain mud with medicinal properties that are used 
               to treat skin, rheumatic and arthritic ailments. Māori 
               traditionally used the mud to treat stomach infections by
               mixing a small amount with water and drinking it.
               Mud pools are created in areas that have limited hot water, 
               but abundant supplies of steam and rock.
               That “pongy” smell Rotorua is famous for is due to hydrogen 
               sulphide released by geothermal features. When released into 
               the air, the hydrogen sulphide reacts with oxygen, creating 
               sulphuric acid. This acid has the ability to dissolve rock 
               into fine particles of silica and clay, and when combined 
               with a small supply of water, a mud pool is created.
               The Rotorua Thermal Mud used in face masks and other beauty 
               products is sourced from mud pools about ten times the size of 
               Ngāmōkaiakoko Mud Pool. You can purchase some of these
               products from Te Puia’s Gift Shop.

               alt="Pohutu Geyser">
            <h2 class="card-text">Pohutu Geyser</h2>
            <p>
               Our main geyser is called “Pohutu” which means “Big splash” and 
               erupts up to heights of 30 meters. Pohutu is semi-predictable,
               as she plays 15-20 minutes after another of our active geysers.
               According to Maori culture, geysers are viewed as gifts from 
               the gods
               To the left of Pohutu (when viewing from the bridge) is the 
               “Prince of Wales Feathers” Geyser – named after Prince Edward
               Albert visited here in the 1900’s. It was traditionally named
               the “Tohu” or sign as it usually plays 10 mins before and 
               then simultaneously with Pohutu and reaches heights of up 
               to seven metres (almost 23 feet).
               The “Kererū” Geyser erupts every few days from the blackened 
               crater closest to Puarenga Stream. The fan-shaped jet can 
               reach heights of up to 15 metres (just over 49 feet). It is 
               named after the New Zealand Pigeon.
               Geysers act like a giant pressure cooker on earth, shooting 
               boiling water and steam into the air.
               All geysers have three components; an intensive heat source, 
               a constant supply of water and an underground plumbing system.
               As rainfall fills the intricate plumbing system below the 
               earth’s surface, molten rock rapidly heats the water.
               The water is under significant pressure causing the boiling 
               point to be well over 125 degrees Celsius.
               As pockets of water become turbulent, the pressure is relieved
               by violently shooting steam and water into the air with 
               tremendous force.

            <h2 class="card-text">Geothermal Valley</h2>
            <p>
               There are over 500 pools and 65 geyser vents, each with their 
               own name, are found in the 70 hectare Te Whakarewarewa 
               geothermal valley in Rotorua.
               Our traditional Maori explanation of Te Whakarewarewa 
               Geothermal Valley states that this place was one of the 
               area’s ‘Te Pupu’ and ‘Te Hoata’, the Goddesses of Fire,
               emerged from the earth’s core while trying to find their 
               brother Ngātoro-i-rangi, who was stranded on Mount Tongariro. 
               As they rose to the surface looking for their brother, they 
               left part of the fire they carried, creating geysers, hot 
               springs and mud pools, creating the geothermal activity 
               that remains today.
